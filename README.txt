PROJECT 1

Screenshots:
labeled "1"- no issues, works 100% properly
labeled "2"- no issues, works 100% properly
labeled "3"- no issues, works 100% properly
labeled "4"- no issues, works 100% properly
labeled "5"- The total number is equal to 1000 and each process is produced
and consumed once. CPU time also matches. Lastly, sadly, my module will not exit without
erroring because it goes into deadlock. This does not make sense to me because my code works
properly with every other test case. 
labeled "6"- no issues, works 100% properly

producer_consumer.c:
no issues other than not being able to fix the lock up issue on #5!

Thanks so much for taking the time to grade my work. Have a great one!
